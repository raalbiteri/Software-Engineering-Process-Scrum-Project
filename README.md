# Software-Engineering-Process-Scrum-Project

Project meant to improve Scrum skills of team. Overall the project is designed for a student to
upload a transcript and get recommendations about what classes to take next quarter/year.

Personal Progress in files: TranscriptParser.java, RecommendCourses.java, CSVParser.java

TranscriptParser: Meant to extract data from a unofficial transcript pdf file given by my.msoe.edu
  in which the student's name, major, and courses taken are stored.

RecommendedCourses: Meant to recommend classes for next quarter based on major, current curriculum, unofficial
  transcripts, and what classes are being offered.

CSVParser: Used to parse the given csv file, offerings.csv/electives.csv, in order to extract the
  courses majors and which terms/electives that they are available to take
